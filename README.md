## Prerequisites

- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) or Claude Code
- Node.js v20 or higher
- An iCloud account with an app-specific password

## Setup

### 1. Generate an Apple App-Specific Password

1. Go to [appleid.apple.com](https://appleid.apple.com)
2. Sign in and navigate to **Sign-In and Security → App-Specific Passwords**
3. Click **+** to generate a new password
4. Label it something like `Claude MCP` and save the generated password

### 2. Install the package

```bash
npm install -g icloud-mcp
```

Then find the install location:

```bash
npm root -g
```

The path varies by setup:

| Setup | Typical path |
|-------|-------------|
| Mac with Homebrew Node | `/opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules` |
| Mac with system Node | `/usr/local/lib/node_modules` |
| nvm | `~/.nvm/versions/node/v20.x.x/lib/node_modules` |

### 3. Verify your setup

Before configuring Claude Desktop, run the doctor command to confirm everything is working:

```bash
IMAP_USER="you@icloud.com" IMAP_PASSWORD="your-app-specific-password" node $(npm root -g)/icloud-mcp/index.js --doctor
```

You should see:

```
icloud-mcp doctor
─────────────────────────────
✅ IMAP_USER is set
✅ IMAP_PASSWORD is set
✅ IMAP_USER looks like an email address
✅ Connected to imap.mail.me.com:993
✅ Authenticated as you@icloud.com
✅ INBOX opened (12453 messages)
─────────────────────────────
All checks passed. Ready to use with Claude Desktop.
```

If any step fails, a plain-English explanation and suggested fix will be shown.

### 4. Connect to Claude

#### Claude Desktop

Open your Claude Desktop config file:

```bash
open ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

Add the following under `mcpServers`, replacing the path with your npm root from step 2:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "icloud-mail": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/icloud-mcp/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "IMAP_USER": "you@icloud.com",
        "IMAP_PASSWORD": "your-app-specific-password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then fully quit Claude Desktop (Cmd+Q) and reopen it.

#### Claude Code

Run this command once to register the server for your user account (available across all projects):

```bash
claude mcp add icloud-mail \
  --scope user \
  -e IMAP_USER=you@icloud.com \
  -e IMAP_PASSWORD=your-app-specific-password \
  -- node $(npm root -g)/icloud-mcp/index.js
```

Or use `npx` to avoid needing a global install:

```bash
claude mcp add icloud-mail \
  --scope user \
  -e IMAP_USER=you@icloud.com \
  -e IMAP_PASSWORD=your-app-specific-password \
  -- npx -y icloud-mcp
```

Verify it registered correctly:

```bash
claude mcp list
```

> **Running from source?** Copy `.mcp.json.example` to `.mcp.json`, set your credentials in your shell, then run `claude` from the repo directory. Claude Code will pick up the config automatically.

### 5. Add Custom Instructions (Recommended)

For large inbox operations, add the following to Claude Desktop's custom instructions to ensure Claude stays on track and checks in with you regularly. Go to **Claude Desktop → Settings → Custom Instructions** and add:

```
When using icloud-mail tools:
1. Before starting any multi-step operation, call log_clear then log_write with your full plan
2. After every single tool call, call log_write with what you did and the result
3. After every 3 tool calls, stop and summarize progress to the user and wait for confirmation before continuing
4. Never assume a bulk operation succeeded — always verify with count_emails after
5. If you are ever unsure what you have done so far, call log_read before proceeding
```

### 6. Start using it

You're all set. Try asking Claude:

- *"Show me the top senders in my iCloud inbox"*
- *"How many unread emails do I have?"*

| `sender` | string | Match exact sender email address |
| `domain` | string | Match any sender from this domain (e.g. `substack.com`) |
| `subject` | string | Keyword to match in subject |
| `before` | string | Only emails before this date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `since` | string | Only emails since this date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `unread` | boolean | `true` for unread only, `false` for read only |

| `larger` | number | Only emails larger than this size in KB |
| `smaller` | number | Only emails smaller than this size in KB |
| `hasAttachment` | boolean | Only emails with attachments (requires narrow pre-filters — scans up to 500 candidates) |

## Safe Move

All bulk move operations (`bulk_move`, `bulk_move_by_sender`, `bulk_move_by_domain`, `archive_older_than`) use a three-phase copy-verify-delete approach:

1. **Copy** — all emails are copied to the destination in chunks
2. **Verify** — every email is fingerprinted and confirmed present in the destination
3. **Delete** — source emails are removed in a single EXPUNGE only after verification passes

A persistent manifest at `~/.icloud-mcp-move-manifest.json` tracks progress so a crash or dropped connection never results in data loss. Use `get_move_status` to inspect any operation and `abandon_move` to clear a stuck one.

## Example Usage

Once configured, you can ask Claude things like:

- *"Show me the top senders in my iCloud inbox"*
- *"What's eating the most storage in my inbox?"*
- *"How many unread emails do I have from substack.com?"*
- *"Find all emails in this thread and summarize the conversation"*
- *"Move all emails from substack.com older than 2023 to my Newsletters folder"*
- *"Archive everything in my inbox older than 1 year"*
- *"Delete all unread emails from linkedin.com before 2022"*
- *"What's the unsubscribe link for this newsletter?"*
- *"Show me the 3 largest attachments in my inbox this month"*
- *"Flag all unread emails from my bank"*
- *"Create a rule that moves all emails from spotify.com to bulk-mail/services"*
